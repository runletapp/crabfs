# ðŸ¦€ CrabFS

CrabFS is a distributed (p2p) blockstorage that is easily embeddable and supports file seeking without downloading the whole file.

See [examples](https://github.com/runletapp/crabfs/tree/master/examples) for a concrete example.

## This is a big WIP. Use with caution and PR's are welcome
